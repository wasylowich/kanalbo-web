# Kanalbo Web Community Project

A website and online community for residents of the Kanalbo cooperative.

Kanalbo, known as "Andelsboligforeningen Kanalbo" in Danish, is a small community of residents living in the Christianshavn neighborhood of Copenhagen, Denmark. The building was established in 1905 and houses 48 apartments overlooking a picturesque canal just outside the core of Copenhagen.

This project is an effort to not only build a web site that will offer a window to the outside world of the community and its surroundings, but also to create a social outlet in which residents can fraternize, share and even litigate in a central online meeting point.
